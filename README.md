## Description 

This project involves transforming the provided starter code into a fully functional Node.js command-line application. The primary objective is to create a tool that allows a manager to easily generate an HTML webpage containing essential information about the members of a software engineering team. The generated webpage will provide quick access to each team member's emails and GitHub profiles.

A set of initial code files, as depicted in the second commit, was given, featuring starter js and test.js files. The project then underwent further development, incorporating my recently acquired skills in Object-Oriented Programming. Below, I outline how these skills were seamlessly integrated into the project:

- Constructors & Prototype
- Test-Driven Development (derive code from test.js files)
- ES6 Classes

<!-- ## Installation

In your terminal, change directory to a location where you would like to clone the repo, then run the below code line by line:
``` terminal
git clone git@github.com:ItIsMLiu/readme-generator.git
```
``` terminal
cd readme-generator 
```
``` terminal
npm install inquirer@8.0.0
```
``` terminal
node index.js
```

## Usage 

This application uses Jest for running the unit tests and Inquirer for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:
``` terminal
node index.js
```


To launch the README generator application, open your terminal and proceed with the installation steps outlined above. Subsequently, the user will receive prompts to provide information regarding the application repository, including the project title, description, table of contents, installation instructions, usage details, licensing information, contribution guidelines, testing procedures, and any questions they may have.

The command-line application will seamlessly process user input, culminating in the generation of a polished and professional README.md file, complete with the relevant sections and details. The chosen license badge, selected from a predefined list, is placed beneath the README file's title. In the Questions section, the user's provided GitHub username, email address, and a link to their GitHub profile are automatically incorporated, accompanied by instructions for reaching them with further inquiries. Clicking on the links within the Table of Contents seamlessly navigates users to the corresponding sections of the README.

The sample_README.md file is generated and stored in the readme-generator folder.
